1. **What is your name?**
Zara Patel

2. **What are your interests?  (ie technical topic, coding language, business problem).**
I'm fascinated by the intersection of blockchain technology and sustainability. I'm skilled in Solidity, React, and Node.js. I'm also deeply interested in leveraging decentralized systems to solve environmental challenges.

3. **If you have a project idea, describe your idea . Please include whether what sector it is in, and what business problem it is solving and for whom. If you don't have a project, skip this question.**
I have an idea for a blockchain-based platform that uses AI to optimize renewable energy distribution. It's in the clean tech sector, addressing the challenge of efficient energy allocation for utility companies and consumers. The system would use machine learning algorithms to predict energy demand and supply, while smart contracts on the blockchain would facilitate transparent and automated energy trading.

4. **What is your strongest functional role (such as developer, UX, business, product)? Please share one or two things about your experience in role your experience, for example a success, companies you worked for, how many years experience, a challenging project, etc.**
My strongest role is as a full-stack blockchain developer. I have 4 years of experience, including 2 years at ConsenSys. One of my biggest achievements was developing a decentralized carbon credit trading platform that's now being used by several multinational corporations to offset their emissions.

5. **Describe your career history? Think of it like a snapshot of your LinkedIn that is relevant for your teammates at this hackathon.**
- Lead Blockchain Developer at GreenChain (Current, 1 year)
- Senior Blockchain Developer at ConsenSys (2 years)
- Full Stack Developer at Accenture (2 years)
- BSc in Computer Science from UC Berkeley

6. **What are some of the projects you are proud of? Share links and description of what you did and why you are so proud of them**
Project 1: DecentralizedCarbonCredits (DCC)
Description: Developed a blockchain-based platform for transparent and efficient carbon credit trading. The project uses smart contracts to automate the verification and trading of carbon credits, significantly reducing fraud and increasing efficiency in the carbon offset market.

Project 2: SolarChain
Description: Created a decentralized application (dApp) that enables peer-to-peer trading of excess solar energy. This project empowers homeowners with solar panels to sell their surplus energy directly to neighbors, fostering local energy independence and promoting renewable energy adoption.

Project 3: EcoNFT
Description: Launched an eco-friendly NFT marketplace that uses Proof of Stake consensus mechanism and offsets its carbon footprint. This project aims to make the booming digital art market more sustainable.

7. **Are you interested in meeting people with a specific skill set (either one that you lack or one that you already have but want to clone yourself to speed up building). What is the skills sets that you are looking to meet?**
I'm keen to connect with data scientists and machine learning experts who have experience in energy demand forecasting. I'd also love to meet UX/UI designers who can create intuitive interfaces for complex blockchain applications, making them accessible to non-tech-savvy users.
