1. **What is your name?**
Alex Chi

2. **What are your interests?  (ie technical topic, coding language, business problem).**
I'm passionate about AI ethics, natural language processing, and creating accessible technology. I'm proficient in Python, TensorFlow, and have experience with large language models.

3. **If you have a project idea, describe your idea . Please include whether what sector it is in, and what business problem it is solving and for whom. If you don't have a project, skip this question.**
I have an idea for an AI-powered language learning assistant. It's in the edtech sector, solving the problem of personalized language acquisition for adult learners. The project would use GPT-based models to create interactive, context-aware conversations tailored to each user's proficiency level and learning style.

4. **What is your strongest functional role (such as developer, UX, business, product)? Please share one or two things about your experience in role your experience, for example a success, companies you worked for, how many years experience, a challenging project, etc.**
My strongest role is as an AI researcher and developer. I have 5 years of experience, including 3 years at Google AI, where I contributed to the development of BERT. One of my biggest successes was implementing a bias detection and mitigation system for large language models, which is now used across multiple Google products.

5. **Describe your career history? Think of it like a snapshot of your LinkedIn that is relevant for your teammates at this hackathon.**
- AI Research Scientist at OpenAI (Current, 2 years)
- Senior AI Developer at Google AI (3 years)
- Machine Learning Engineer at Coursera (2 years)
- Ph.D. in Computer Science, specializing in NLP, from Stanford University

6. **What are some of the projects you are proud of? Share links and description of what you did and why you are so proud of them**
Project 1: Bias Mitigation in LLMs
Description: Developed a system to detect and mitigate biases in large language models. This project involved creating a comprehensive framework for identifying various types of biases (gender, racial, socioeconomic) and implementing techniques to reduce these biases during model training and inference.

Project 2: Multilingual NLP Toolkit
Description: Created an open-source toolkit for multilingual natural language processing tasks. This project supports over 100 languages and includes modules for tokenization, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.

Project 3: AI-Powered Code Explanation Tool
Description: Developed a tool that uses GPT-3 to generate human-readable explanations of complex code snippets. This project aims to make programming more accessible to beginners and non-technical stakeholders.

7. **Are you interested in meeting people with a specific skill set (either one that you lack or one that you already have but want to clone yourself to speed up building). What is the skills sets that you are looking to meet?**
I'm particularly interested in meeting UX designers and product managers who have experience in educational technology. I'd also love to connect with frontend developers who can create intuitive, accessible interfaces for AI-powered applications.
