1. **What is your name?**
Ethan Zhang

2. **What are your interests?  (ie technical topic, coding language, business problem).**
I'm passionate about artificial intelligence, particularly in the realm of computer vision and its applications in autonomous systems. I'm also deeply interested in edge computing and IoT integration.

3. **If you have a project idea, describe your idea . Please include whether what sector it is in, and what business problem it is solving and for whom. If you don't have a project, skip this question.**
I have an idea for a smart urban traffic management system. It's in the smart city sector, aimed at solving congestion and improving road safety for city dwellers and commuters. The system would use a network of AI-powered cameras and edge devices to analyze traffic patterns in real-time, adjusting traffic signals dynamically and providing predictive insights to city planners.

4. **What is your strongest functional role (such as developer, UX, business, product)? Please share one or two things about your experience in role your experience, for example a success, companies you worked for, how many years experience, a challenging project, etc.**
As a Senior Machine Learning Engineer with 7 years of experience, I specialize in developing and deploying computer vision models. At Tesla, I contributed to their Autopilot system, specifically working on object detection and tracking algorithms. One of my proudest achievements was optimizing our models to run efficiently on Tesla's custom AI chips, significantly improving real-time performance.

- Improved model accuracy by 15% while reducing inference time by 30%
- Implemented novel techniques for handling adverse weather conditions
- Proud because it directly contributes to safer autonomous driving

Project 2: Edge AI for Smart Cities
- Created a prototype system for real-time pedestrian and vehicle detection using edge devices
- Achieved 95% accuracy with a latency of under 50ms on low-power hardware
- Open-sourced the project, now used by several smart city initiatives globally
- Proud because it demonstrates the potential of AI in improving urban living

Project 3: AI-Powered Drone Navigation
- Developed a vision-based navigation system for autonomous drones
- Implemented SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques for GPS-denied environments
- The system was adopted by a leading drone manufacturer for search and rescue operations
- Proud because it showcases how AI can be used in life-saving applications

7. **Are you interested in meeting people with a specific skill set (either one that you lack or one that you already have but want to clone yourself to speed up building). What is the skills sets that you are looking to meet?**
I'm keen to connect with full-stack developers who have experience in building scalable cloud infrastructure. I'm also looking to meet UX/UI designers who can help create intuitive interfaces for complex AI systems. Additionally, I'm interested in meeting domain experts in urban planning or traffic management who can provide insights into the practical challenges of implementing smart city solutions.
