1. **What is your name?**
Aisha Rodriguez

2. **What are your interests?  (ie technical topic, coding language, business problem).**
I'm passionate about sustainable design, biomimicry, and circular economy principles. I'm particularly interested in how these concepts can be applied to product design and manufacturing processes to reduce environmental impact.

3. **If you have a project idea, describe your idea . Please include whether what sector it is in, and what business problem it is solving and for whom. If you don't have a project, skip this question.**
My project idea is in the consumer goods sector, focusing on biodegradable packaging solutions. I want to develop a line of food packaging that mimics natural structures for strength and durability, but is completely compostable. This would address the massive problem of plastic waste in our oceans and landfills, benefiting both consumers and the environment.

4. **What is your strongest functional role (such as developer, UX, business, product)? Please share one or two things about your experience in role your experience, for example a success, companies you worked for, how many years experience, a challenging project, etc.**
As an Industrial Designer with 6 years of experience, I specialize in sustainable product design. At IDEO, I led a project to redesign a major electronics company's product packaging, reducing plastic use by 80% while improving unboxing experience. This project won a Red Dot Design Award for its innovative approach to sustainability.

5. **Describe your career history? Think of it like a snapshot of your LinkedIn that is relevant for your teammates at this hackathon.**

7. **Are you interested in meeting people with a specific skill set (either one that you lack or one that you already have but want to clone yourself to speed up building). What is the skills sets that you are looking to meet?**
I'm keen to connect with materials scientists who can help develop new biodegradable materials. I'm also looking to meet software engineers experienced in lifecycle assessment tools to quantify environmental impact. Additionally, I'd love to collaborate with business strategists who can help bring sustainable product ideas to market effectively.
