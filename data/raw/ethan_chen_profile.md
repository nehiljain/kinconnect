1. **What is your name?**
Ethan Chen

2. **What are your interests?  (ie technical topic, coding language, business problem).**
I'm passionate about blockchain technology, smart contracts, and decentralized finance (DeFi). I'm also interested in Rust programming and cryptography.

3. **If you have a project idea, describe your idea . Please include whether what sector it is in, and what business problem it is solving and for whom. If you don't have a project, skip this question.**
I have an idea for a decentralized identity verification system for the fintech sector. It aims to solve the problem of secure and private identity management for financial institutions and their customers, reducing fraud and streamlining KYC processes.

4. **What is your strongest functional role (such as developer, UX, business, product)? Please share one or two things about your experience in role your experience, for example a success, companies you worked for, how many years experience, a challenging project, etc.**
I'm primarily a blockchain developer with 5 years of experience. I've worked at Consensys for 3 years, where I contributed to the development of Ethereum 2.0. One of my biggest achievements was optimizing gas fees for a popular DeFi protocol, resulting in a 30% reduction in transaction costs.

5. **Describe your career history? Think of it like a snapshot of your LinkedIn that is relevant for your teammates at this hackathon.**
- Senior Blockchain Developer at Consensys (2020 - Present)
- Blockchain Developer at ChainSafe Systems (2018 - 2020)
- Software Engineer at IBM (2016 - 2018)
- Computer Science degree from Stanford University (2012 - 2016)

6. **What are some of the projects you are proud of? Share links and description of what you did and why you are so proud of them**
Project 1: EthSwap
- GitHub: https://github.com/ethanchen/ethswap
- Description: Developed a decentralized exchange (DEX) on Ethereum that allows for atomic swaps between ERC-20 tokens. Implemented advanced order matching algorithms and integrated with multiple liquidity pools. Proud of its efficiency and user-friendly interface.

Project 2: ZKProof
- GitHub: https://github.com/ethanchen/zkproof
- Description: Created a zero-knowledge proof library in Rust for privacy-preserving transactions on blockchain. This project significantly reduced the computational overhead of ZK-SNARKs, making them more practical for real-world applications.

Project 3: DeFi Dashboard
- Live demo: https://defi-dashboard.ethanchen.com
- Description: Built a comprehensive dashboard for tracking and managing DeFi investments across multiple protocols. Proud of its intuitive design and real-time data aggregation capabilities.

7. **Are you interested in meeting people with a specific skill set (either one that you lack or one that you already have but want to clone yourself to speed up building). What is the skills sets that you are looking to meet?**
I'm looking to connect with UX/UI designers who have experience in creating intuitive interfaces for complex blockchain applications. I'm also interested in meeting data scientists who can help with predictive analytics for DeFi protocols.
