I have an idea for a blockchain-based platform that revolutionizes fair trade in the coffee industry. It would provide transparency from farm to cup, ensuring fair compensation for farmers and authentic products for consumers. This solution aims to address issues of exploitation and fraud in the global coffee supply chain.
